# Create Branch Skill

## Overview

Create a new git branch based on description with optional worktree setup for parallel development.

## When to Use

- Starting new feature development
- Creating fix/hotfix branches
- Setting up worktree for parallel work
- Organizing branch structure

## Process

### 1. Gather Branch Information

**If description provided:**
- Use provided description to generate branch name

**If no description:**
- Analyze uncommitted changes using `git diff` and `git status`
- Generate description from changes
- Confirm with user

### 2. Generate Branch Name

Follow naming conventions:
- `feature/<name>` - New features
- `fix/<name>` - Bug fixes
- `refactor/<name>` - Refactoring
- `docs/<name>` - Documentation
- `test/<name>` - Testing
- `chore/<name>` - Maintenance
- `hotfix/<name>` - Urgent fixes

**Guidelines:**
- Lowercase with hyphens
- Concise but descriptive (2-5 words)
- Present tense verbs

### 3. Validate Branch

Before creation:
- Check if branch already exists
- Verify naming conventions
- Check for special characters
- Suggest alternatives if conflicts

### 4. Ask Worktree Preference

Use AskUserQuestion to ask:

```
選擇建立方式：

1. Branch Only (建議用於短期工作)
   - 在當前目錄建立並切換到新分支

2. Branch + Worktree (建議用於長期功能開發)
   - 建立獨立工作目錄
   - 可同時在多個分支工作
```

### 5. Execute Creation

**Branch Only:**
```bash
git checkout -b <branch-name>
```

**Branch + Worktree:**
```bash
PROJECT_NAME=$(basename $(pwd))
git worktree add ../${PROJECT_NAME}.worktrees.${BRANCH_NAME} -b ${BRANCH_NAME}
```

**Worktree Directory Structure:**
```
parent-dir/
├── my-project/                          # Main repository
└── my-project.worktrees.feature/
    ├── add-auth/                        # feature/add-auth
    └── dark-mode/                       # feature/dark-mode
└── my-project.worktrees.fix/
    └── memory-leak/                     # fix/memory-leak
```

### 6. Report Results

After creation, report:
- Created branch name
- Current location (worktree path if applicable)
- Next steps suggestion

## Examples

**Input:** "add user authentication"
**Branch:** `feature/add-user-auth`

**Input:** "fix login bug"
**Branch:** `fix/login-bug`

**Input:** (empty, detected changes in auth files)
**Branch:** `feature/auth-improvements`

## Safety Checks

- Verify working directory is clean (or offer to stash)
- Ensure git repository is initialized
- Check disk space for worktree
- Confirm base branch is up to date

## Worktree Management Commands

```bash
# List worktrees
git worktree list

# Remove worktree
git worktree remove ../<project>.worktrees.<branch>

# Prune deleted worktrees
git worktree prune
```
